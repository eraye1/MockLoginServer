# MockLoginServer

A super-light mock server to develop with login information sent to the server.

Built with Flask!

**Currently supports Testing Basic Auth with username=admin and password=secret**

Authenticating successfully to login should give you:

{
    "session": "27512c68d4256df311254f51109fb8fd831fbf1bd40b27a865f902c2",
    "status": 200
}

Todo:
    Still needs some work with logging.
